    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a recipe for an old-fashioned, decadent custard. You can use simple ingredients that you probably have at home to make this delicious recipe. While incredibly simple, this custard has a beautiful velvety texture, and the addition of cornstarch makes it even richer.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon butter</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Place milk, vanilla extract, and butter in a saucepan.</li>
        <li>Cook and stir over medium heat until simmering; remove from heat before it comes to a boil.</li>
        <li>Whisk eggs, sugar, and cornstarch together in a bowl until sugar dissolves.</li>
        <li>Set the saucepan back over low heat. Pour in egg mixture slowly, whisking constantly, until custard thickens enough to coat the bottom of a spoon, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve warm or transfer custard into a large bowl and cover.</li>
        <li>Allow to cool before chilling. Enjoy!</li>
